PHP-eshop-OTE-2007


This is my dissertation at the Master of Informatics of the University of the Aegean in Mitilini Island.

The back end is written with PHP and the front end is with Macromedia Flash.

Î‘fter a few years Macromedia Flash it was abolished.

Macromedia Flash could embedded in HTML Web Page and it was a very good choise for frond end.


It is a eshop for my company OTE(Hellenic Telecomunication Company) and written in 2007.

There is the clients side where someone can buy telecommunication products, and there is the Administrator side where the administrator can check the orders, can and new products,
can delete, update pdoducts. Also administrator can add, delete or update categories of products. Administrator can also do the same with Brands and finaly can see some statistics about the clients.
When the order is completed the client and the administrors receives and email about the order.


There is no index.php start file.
The front end of the project starts with "ote-shop_13.swf" file.
The back end of the project starts with "ote-shop_13.swf" file.
